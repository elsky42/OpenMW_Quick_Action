## How to use it

Quick Action is a HUD Widget that can be toggled and configured via the widget itself.
You can toggle the widget by using `X`. This will open the first *list* of actions.

You can then select an action using `mouse look` or the `mouse wheel` and then press the left `mouse button` to activate the action. You can also add a new action using `N`, delete the selected action using `delete`, and change the position of the selected action using `]` and `BackSlash`.

When the Widget is visibile you can switch to the next  list by using `Z`, add a new list by using `M` and delete the current list by using `End`.
